# Web-design-Challenge

* In this project, I analyzed Apple's stock, the S&P 500 index, and Oil. I wanted to see how their price has changed and if there was an increase in volatility. 

* I used python to perform all of the analysis and created several graphs. There are more graphs in the "Stock analysis" file under the resources folder. I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create the website. 

* All of the data is under the DATA folder. 

* Click this link to see the website and some of the research I did.
